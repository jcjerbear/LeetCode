# 038.count_and_say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
```1``` is read off as ```"one 1"``` or ```11```.

```11``` is read off as ```"two 1s"``` or ```21```.

```21``` is read off as ```"one 2```, then ```one 1"``` or ```1211```.

Given an integer n, generate the n<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
