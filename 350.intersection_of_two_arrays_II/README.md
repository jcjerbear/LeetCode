# 350.intersection_of_two_arrays_II

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

__Example:__

Given nums1 = ```[1, 2, 2, 1]```, nums2 = ```[2, 2]```, return ```[2, 2]```.

__Note:__

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

__Follow up:__

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
